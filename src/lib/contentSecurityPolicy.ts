/**
 * ============================================================================
 *  THE WEBSITE'S SECURITY POLICY, FOR HOSTS THAT CAN'T SEND HEADERS
 * ============================================================================
 * A "Content Security Policy" (CSP) tells the browser what this page may load and run. It stops an
 * injected <script> from running even if a bug ever let one into the page.
 *
 * Netlify sends the policy as a header (see `netlify.toml`). GitHub Pages can't send custom headers,
 * so for the github.io site the same policy is written into the page itself as a
 * `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` tag, added by `vite.config.ts` when building.
 *
 * Two rules from the Netlify version can't work inside a <meta> tag (browsers ignore them there), so
 * they are left out here: `frame-ancestors` (stop other sites showing ShiftFit in a frame) and the
 * separate `X-Frame-Options` header. That protection exists only on hosts that send headers.
 *
 * The tag is added to the BUILT site only. The dev server (`npm run dev`) runs small inline scripts
 * for instant reloading, which this policy would block.
 */

/**
 * The policy, one rule per entry (see `netlify.toml` for what each rule means). `connect-src` allows
 * any https address because the ShiftFit server (the gateway) lives on a different site than github.io.

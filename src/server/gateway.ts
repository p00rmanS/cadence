/**
 * ============================================================================
 *  THE GATEWAY: THE ONLY SERVER THE WEBSITE TALKS TO
 * ============================================================================
 * The website runs in the manager's browser, and anything in a browser can be read or changed by
 * whoever is using it. So the browser is never trusted with the n8n password or allowed to decide
 * what goes onto Google Calendar. Instead it asks this gateway, which:
 *
 *   browser --(manager passcode)--> gateway --(secret the browser never sees)--> n8n --> Google Calendar
 *
 *  1. checks the manager passcode (and slows down anyone guessing it),
 *  2. re-checks the WHOLE schedule with the app's own rule code (`src/features/scheduling`),
 *  3. rebuilds the calendar events itself, so a tampered browser can't send made-up events,
 *  4. refuses if the schedule changed after the manager approved it,
 *  5. only then calls n8n, and checks n8n's reply before passing it back.
 *
 * Addresses (all POST, all need `Authorization: Bearer <manager passcode>`):
 *  - `/api/session`   "is this passcode right?" (used by the sign-in box)
 *  - `/api/publish`   send an approved schedule to Google Calendar
 *  - `/api/remove`    delete old events the manager confirmed (moved or removed shifts)
 *  - `/api/interpret` read a class-schedule screenshot
 *  - `/api/health`    (GET, no passcode) "is the server up and fully set up?" for whoever hosts it. It
 *                     answers only `{ ok: true, ready: true|false }`, never a setting or any student data.
 *
 * It is one plain function, `handleGateway(Request) -> Response`, so it runs on Netlify Functions
 * (see `netlify/functions/gateway.ts`) or any similar host. Until ALL THREE settings below are set it
 * answers 503 to everything ("fail closed"), so deploying it early can't open anything up.

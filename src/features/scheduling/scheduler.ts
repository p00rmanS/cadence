 * ============================================================================
 * This is the most complex file in the app: the code behind the "Fill
 * schedule for me" button. In plain terms, it tries lots of possible shifts,
 * scores each one (a lower score is better), and repeatedly places the
 * best-scoring one until the week is staffed and everyone is near their
 * target hours. It is NOT artificial intelligence — it's an ordinary,
 * rules-based algorithm (a "greedy" planner, in scheduling-textbook terms).
 * Given the exact same students and settings, it always produces the exact
 * same schedule; nothing about it is random or learned.
 *
 * Reading order: `autoFill` at the bottom of this file is the entry point —
 * start there, then come back up to `Plan`/`evaluate`/`place` as you need
 * them. It runs in three phases, explained where each phase begins below.

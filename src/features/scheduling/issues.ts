 * box). This file checks rules AFTER the fact, across the whole schedule —
 * because a shift that was fine when it was placed can become a problem later
 * (e.g. the manager edits a student's class times, and an old shift now sits
 * on top of the new class). It also writes the plain-language "who's free /
 * why not" text used throughout the app.

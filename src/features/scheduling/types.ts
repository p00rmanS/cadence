/**
 * ============================================================================
 *  SHARED "SHAPES" FOR THE SCHEDULING ENGINE
 * ============================================================================
 * This file has no logic in it — it only describes the SHAPE of the data every
 * other file in `src/features/scheduling/` reads and writes (TypeScript calls
 * these shapes "types"). Think of it as the glossary/blueprint for the app:
 * every other scheduling file imports names from here instead of re-describing
 * the same data differently in five places.
 *
 * A few conventions used everywhere below:
 * - Time of day is stored as `Minutes`, an integer number of minutes since
 *   midnight (9:00am = 540, 5:00pm = 1020). This makes comparing and adding
 *   times plain arithmetic instead of string/Date juggling. `formatMinutes`
 *   in `time.ts` turns a number like 540 back into "9:00am" for display.
 * - The work week only covers Monday–Friday (see `Day` below); there is no
 *   weekend scheduling in this app.

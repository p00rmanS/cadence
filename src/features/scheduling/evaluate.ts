/**
 * ============================================================================
 *  ONE-CALL SCHEDULE REPORT: "IS THIS SCHEDULE ALLOWED, AND HOW GOOD IS IT?"
 * ============================================================================
 * The app already has separate functions for each question (rule problems in `issues.ts`, coverage in
 * `coverage.ts`, hours in `availability.ts`). This file asks all of them at once and returns a single
 * plain report. Two things use it:
 *  - the server check (`src/server/handler.ts`), which re-validates a schedule before it is published, and
 *  - any screen that wants headline numbers without doing the math itself.
 * It only READS a schedule; it never changes one. The rules themselves are not repeated here, so they
 * cannot drift apart from the ones the grid and auto-fill use.

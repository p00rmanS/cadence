 *  RULE-CHECKING: "CAN THIS STUDENT WORK THIS SLOT?"
 * ============================================================================
 * This file answers yes/no questions about one student and one 30-minute grid
 * box at a time: are they busy then, would it push them over their weekly
 * hours, have they already worked their max days, etc. It is the single
 * source of truth for the scheduling rules — the grid (when you click a box),
 * "Fill schedule for me" (`scheduler.ts`), and the health checker
 * (`issues.ts`) all call into these same functions, so a rule only ever has
 * to be written once. Start with `canAssign` — it's the main entry point.

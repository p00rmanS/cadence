 * ============================================================================
 *  SEMESTER VS. BREAK
 * ============================================================================
 * Two rules change depending on whether classes are in session (the
 * "Semester / Break" switch at the top of the app):
 * - Tuesday devotional (11:00am–12:00pm) is closed during the semester and
 *   open during a break.
 * - The weekly hour limit is the normal one (19) during the semester and
 *   BREAK_WEEKLY_HOURS (40) during a break.
 * Every other file asks these helpers instead of checking `settings.term`
 * itself, so the two rules are written only here.

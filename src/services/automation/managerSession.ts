 *  MANAGER SIGN-IN (the passcode that unlocks the server features)
 * ============================================================================
 * Sending to Google Calendar and reading screenshots both go through the ShiftFit server
 * (`src/server/gateway.ts`), and the server only helps someone who knows the manager passcode.
 * This file remembers the passcode for as long as this browser tab stays open, and sends it with
 * each server request as an `Authorization: Bearer <passcode>` header.
 *
 * Why only in memory (a plain variable)? It is never written to localStorage, cookies or a file,
 * so it disappears when the tab is closed or reloaded and can't be picked up later by someone
 * else using the same computer. The cost is typing it again after a reload.
 *
 * Nothing here decides who is allowed in: the SERVER checks the passcode every single time. This
 * file only asks the server "is this passcode right?" once, so the screen can say so straight away.

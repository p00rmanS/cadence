 * ============================================================================
 * ShiftFit itself never talks to Google Calendar. Instead, when the manager
 * presses "Save & share" -> publish, this app sends a plain description of
 * the approved shifts to a separate server (an automation tool called n8n —
 * see `docs/N8N_ARCHITECTURE.md` and the `n8n/` folder) which is responsible
 * for actually creating Google Calendar events. This file defines the exact
 * shape of that request and response (a "contract" both sides agree to), and
 * `validatePublishResponse` makes sure whatever comes back matches it before
 * the app trusts it — the same "never trust outside data blindly" pattern
 * used in `../../features/scheduling/validation.ts`.
